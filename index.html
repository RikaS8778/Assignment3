                        <p>The 2024 IFSC Climbing World Cup begins early next week with two back-to-back stops in China. These events not only kick off the World Cup series, but also what is sure to be a blockbuster year of international-level competitions. On top the World Cup, 2024 sees many of the best climbers in the world facing off in the Olympic Qualifier Series this spring and the Paris Olympics this summer.<br>The World Cup circuit in 2024 will have nine stops: two each in China and France, and one each in the United States, Austria, Slovenia, Czechia, and South Korea. Across these nine World Cups, there will be five Boulder events, six Lead events, and five Speed events. The series starts in Keqiao and Wujiang China in April before moving to Salt Lake City in May. It then goes on a tour of European cities in June, July, and September – Innsbruck, Chamonix, Briançon, Koper, and Prague. The final World Cup will be held in early October in Seoul, South Korea.<br>Three Paraclimbing World Cups will also be held in 2024: Salt Lake City on May 7–8, Innsbruck on June 24–25, and Arco on September 27–28. The full World Cup schedule for 2024 is listed below.<br><a href="https://gripped.com/indoor-climbing/2024-is-a-huge-year-for-comp-climbing-heres-the-schedule/">Read more...</a></p>

                        <p>New to climbing and want to improve your confidence with dynamic movement? Or perhaps you’re a long-time climber who almost exclusively uses static movements and wants to become more dynamic? If so, then this article is for you.<br>Being able to move dynamically is an essential tool in climbing. It helps you execute dead points, dynos, and long throws. Dynamic movement is deeper than just these big, burly moves though. When implemented properly, being dynamic can also improve efficiency as you move up the wall, conserving momentum and flowing from hold to hold.<br>Here are five exercises to get you started on the path to becoming a more dynamic climber. Three are off-wall exercises and two are on-wall. Choose three exercises (ideally two off-wall and one on-wall) that you can perform once or twice weekly, either before a bouldering or route climbing session or on a specific power training day. Before doing these exercises, make sure you warm up thoroughly.<br><a href="https://gripped.com/indoor-climbing/new-to-dynamic-moves-here-are-five-exercises-to-get-started/">Read more...</a></p>
